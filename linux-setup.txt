Wherein I document exactly how to re-setup my system after ruining it.

In no real order after the first couple

apt-get update and apt get upgrade
apt-get install git vim curl man-db
apt-get install rxvt-unicode(-256color?)

Clone in dotfiles.
Symlink all (relevant) files from .dotfiles into home folder

setup ssh (also on github) or copy in existing key

copy clipboard file into /usr/lib/urxvt/perl
apt-get install xclip

apt-get i3blocks. If it's not available, build it from the source at: github.com/vivien/i3blocks 
This can be put off for later if .i3/config is edited to not call to this library

install chrome

install tig from source at: github.com/jonas/tig 

install python 2.7
apt-get install python-pip
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install virtualenvwrapper

enable utf-8 locale
this is a huge pain sometimes, make sure to restart because apparently some changes
only take affect after doing so

sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion/master/git-flow-completion.bash > git-flow-completion.bash
sudo mv git-flow-completion.bash /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash > git-completion.bash
sudo mv git-completion.bash /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/

install i3block scripts from https://github.com/Anachron/i3blocks or git@github.com:mattbreeden/i3blocks.git(branch memory/swap-available) if my PR doesn't get merged
apt-get install bc
apt-get install acpi
