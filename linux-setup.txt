Wherein I document exactly how to re-setup my system after ruining it.

In no real order after the first couple

apt-get update and apt get upgrade
apt-get install git vim curl
apt-get install rxvt-unicode(-256color?)

Clone in dotfiles.
Symlink all (relevant) files from .dotfiles into home folder

copy clipboard file into /usr/lib/urxvt/perl
apt-get install xclip

apt-get i3blocks. If it's not available, build it from the source at: github.com/vivien/i3blocks 
This can be put off for later if .i3/config is edited to not call to this library

install chrome

install tig from source at: github.com/jonas/tig 

install rvm maybe (Should probably delete this and the rvm references in bashrc/profile)

install python 2.7
apt-get install python-pip
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install virtualenvwrapper

enable utf-8 locale
this is a huge pain sometimes, make sure to restart because apparently some changes
only take affect after doing so

install i3bar scripts from 

misc apps:
apt-get install deluge
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo apt-get update
apt-get install zeal - install desired docs
install languages
